At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.[36] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.[37] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.</p>

However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[9] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket</p>

        <h2>HARDIK PANDYA</h2>
        <p>Hardik Pandya is the perfect modern-day cricketer. He can strike the ball big, roll his arm over decently and is a livewire in the field. It is a combination of skills India has long waited for since the retirement of Kapil Dev. Irfan Pathan gave them hope for a while but then lost his mojo and soon disappeared into the wilderness. India will wish that Pandya keeps working on his game and ends the country’s search for a seam-bowling all-rounder.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the 3rd and the final Test match against Sri Lanka at Pallekele, Pandya scored his maiden Test century</li>
                    <li>first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL.</li>
                    <li>Batting: Most runs. 32nd. Most runs in a career without a hundred (1769)</li>
                    <li>Bowling: Most wickets. 3rd. Outstanding bowling analyses in an innings (3/3)</li>
                </ul>
